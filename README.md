# lsc-scanner-cloudapp
An Ex Libris Alma Cloud App for scanning items at the JHU Library Service Center

This is a Cloud App for Alma that allows a user to add a Storage Location ID (what JHU calls an RMST) to a set of items.

It is intended to be used with a barcode scanning device, but can be used manually by entering
a barcode number and pressing enter (equivalent to a carraige return that would be present on the item barcode). 

Storage Location IDs can be removed by keeping the RMST input blank.
